/*
You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with RR rows and CC columns. There are 00 or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell. The cell in the iith row from the top and jjth column from the left either contains a battleship (G_{i,j} = 1G
i,j
​
 =1) or doesn't (G_{i,j} = 0G
i,j
​
 =0).
You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid. You'll choose this cell uniformly at random from the R*CR∗C possible cells. You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship.
Your task is to implement the function getHitProbability(R, C, G) which returns this probability.
Note: Your return value must have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}10
−6
  to be considered correct.
